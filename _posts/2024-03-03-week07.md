Through the research done in class, I've gained respect for the collaborative culture of
open source development and the span of different backgrounds, reasons, and passions held by
it's contributers. Unfortunately, I haven't been in contact with my group this week due to being
sick from the cold, but I will be meeting with them this week to hopefully pick the project we will
want to contribute to.
