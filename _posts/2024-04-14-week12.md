Cristopher Snider's presentation was pretty informative. Compared to the use of open source by enterprise, Tidepool's use fo open source is commendable for being as transparent and accessible as possible, as far as I know. I also appreciate that they actively involve their users in the development process, encouraging plenty of feedback and contributions. Overall, my group is making pretty decent progress compared to where we were last week. Our current issue is just that we are having problems actually putting through our pull requests. There seems to be some kind of permissions related issue. Hopefully this will be resolved this week.
