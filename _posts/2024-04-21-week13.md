Before discussing the Cathedral and the Bazaar in class, my favorite lesson was "The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better." Talking about the different lessons with my classmates, it was helpful to hear them tied to their personal experiences. I found that a lot of the lessons meant the same thing as other lessons, especially the one that I picked. My favorite didn't change, but other peoples' examples helped me appreciate it more, because in a lot of cases the most important thing that a developer can do is treat the user base as their template. My group is making pretty swift progress. Right now we have recieved our notes from the teammates collaborators about what tests that our pull requests are passing and failing. Our current challenge is modifying our code to be able to meet all of these demands in order to work as well as possible.
