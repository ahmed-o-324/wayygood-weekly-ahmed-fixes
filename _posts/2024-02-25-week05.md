I watched the videos about agriculture, and I was really interested in the different approaches people took
to tackle the issue of a rising demand for food from different angles. It was cool to see how
computer scientists are creating ways for everyone to contribute to agriculture and aid in sharing and creating
knowledge to aid farmers through open source technology. Hopefully, as a computer scientist, I would
hope to be able to add to this work by developing open-access educational resources, such as online courses,
tutorials, and instructional videos, to teach farmers and agricultural professionals how to leverage technology effectively. 
By democratizing access to knowledge, these initiatives can empower individuals and communities to improve their agricultural
practices and livelihoods.
